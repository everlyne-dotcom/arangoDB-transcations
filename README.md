<h1>🚀 ArangoHack: LangChain + ArangoDB for Graph-Based QA</h1>
+This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic graph-based question-answering (QA) system using LangChain and ArangoDB. It leverages --+NetworkX for graph construction and LangChain Community for seamless integration with OpenAI models.
&nbsp;
<h2>**🛠️ Features**</h2>
+  ✅ Integration of LangChain with ArangoDB for graph-based queries
+✅ Graph construction and manipulation using NetworkX and nx_arangodb
+✅ OpenAI-powered question answering over graph data
+✅ Dynamic AQL (ArangoDB Query Language) generation
&nbsp;
<h2📦 Requirements></h2>
+Install the required dependencies using:
+pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-openai langgraph arango networkx nx_arangodb pandas numpy matplotlib
&nbsp;
<h2>🚀 Setup</h2>
<h3>**using the arangodb**</h3>
+Install ArangoDB and start the server.
+Configure ArangoDB connection settings.
<h3>**using the arangodb cloud**</h3>
+go to  the arango db cloud
+set credentials & at the overview click on deploy 
+which you will create a database ui which will be you web ui
   &nbsp;
+Load the graph data into ArangoDB using NetworkX.
+Run the LangChain QA model to generate answers based on graph queries.
&nbsp;
<h2>🚀 Usage</h2>
+Running the Notebook
+Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step-by-step:
+jupyter notebook arangohack.ipynb
+Example Query
+You can ask questions about the graph data like:
+
+"What are the direct connections of node X?"

<h2>🧠 How It Works</h2>
+Graph Construction: NetworkX creates a graph and stores it in ArangoDB.
+LangChain Integration: LangChain connects with ArangoDB to process AQL queries.
+OpenAI QA: LangChain generates dynamic AQL queries and retrieves answers using OpenAI models.
&nbsp;
<h2>🎯 Future Improvements</h2>
+Improve query generation using fine-tuned models
+Add support for complex graph relationships
+Optimize query performance in ArangoDB
