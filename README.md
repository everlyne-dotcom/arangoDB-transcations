<h1>🚀 ArangoHack: LangChain + ArangoDB for Graph-Based QA</h1>
This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic graph-based question-answering (QA) system using LangChain and ArangoDB. It leverages NetworkX for graph construction and LangChain Community for seamless integration with OpenAI models.

**🛠️ Features**
✅ Integration of LangChain with ArangoDB for graph-based queries
✅ Graph construction and manipulation using NetworkX and nx_arangodb
✅ OpenAI-powered question answering over graph data
✅ Dynamic AQL (ArangoDB Query Language) generation

📦 Requirements
Install the required dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-openai langgraph arango networkx nx_arangodb pandas numpy matplotlib
🚀 Setup
Install ArangoDB and start the server.
Configure ArangoDB connection settings.
Load the graph data into ArangoDB using NetworkX.
Run the LangChain QA model to generate answers based on graph queries.
🚀 Usage
Running the Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step-by-step:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook arangohack.ipynb
Example Query
You can ask questions about the graph data like:

"What are the direct connections of node X?"

🧠 How It Works
Graph Construction: NetworkX creates a graph and stores it in ArangoDB.
LangChain Integration: LangChain connects with ArangoDB to process AQL queries.
OpenAI QA: LangChain generates dynamic AQL queries and retrieves answers using OpenAI models.
🎯 Future Improvements
Improve query generation using fine-tuned models
Add support for complex graph relationships
Optimize query performance in ArangoDB
